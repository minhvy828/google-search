### About this project
I have started a new journey with CS50W, a course from Harvard University. This course covers database design, scalability, security, user experience and fundamentals of web design. This course evaluates your skills through hands-on projects to help you gain experience writing and using APIs, create interactive UIs, and leverage cloud services like GitHub and Heroku.

Students will need to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make the frontend and use Python with Django and SQL for the backend. This course also introduces essential tools for developers like Git, user interfaces, testing, CI/CD, scalability and security
